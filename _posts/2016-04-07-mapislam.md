## Mapping Islam

I wanted to see how much Islam has spread into the Middle East and Europe over the last 100 years. The Association for Religion Data Archives just added a terrific dataset that has a lot of historical data regarding the world's religious demography. The title is: U.S. Religion Census: Religious Congregations and Membership Study, 2010. A link to the dataset is [here.](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/RCMSCY10.asp)


{% highlight r %}
states <- read.dta("D:/religstates.dta", convert.factors = FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax to create the map is below: 


{% highlight r %}
states1900 <- subset(states, year == 1900)
gtdMap1900 <- joinCountryData2Map( states1900,
nameJoinColumn="abbrev",
joinCode="ISO3" )
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## 80 codes from your data successfully matched countries in the map
## 107 codes from your data failed to match with a country code in the map
## 163 codes from the map weren't represented in your data
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
mapCountryData( gtdMap1900,
nameColumnToPlot='muspct',
catMethod='fixedWidth',
numCats=9, mapTitle='Muslim Percentage in 1900', missingCountryCol= 'white', oceanCol = 'lightblue', mapRegion =  'eurasia' )
{% endhighlight %}

I repeated this syntax for 1910, 1920, etc. to 2010.

I took those 11 images and used an online tool to create an animated gif. That website is [GifMaker](http://gifmaker.me/)
